# Deep Atlas

Deep Atlas is a suite of tools created by the Blue Brain Project to manipulate brain atlas images. 
- [Atlas Download Tools](#atldld) — Search, download, and prepare atlas data.
- [Atlas Alignment](#atlalign) — Perform multimodal image registration and alignment.
- [Atlas Annotation](#atlannot) — Image registration for annotation atlases.
- [Atlas Interpolation](#atlinter) — Image interpolation and optical flow computation.

**Search, download, and prepare atlas data.**

Among different sources of data, Allen Brain Institute hosts a rich database of gene expression images, Nissl volumes, and annotation atlases. The Atlas-Download-Tools library can help you to download single section images and entire datasets, as well as the corresponding metadata. It can further pre-process the image data to place it in the standard reference space.

**Multimodal registration and alignment toolbox.**

Atlas Alignment is a toolbox to perform multimodal image registration. It includes both traditional and supervised deep learning models. This project originated from the Blue Brain Project efforts on aligning mouse brain atlases obtained with ISH gene expression and Nissl stains.
