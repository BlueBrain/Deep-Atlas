Among different sources of data, Allen Brain Institute hosts a rich database of gene expression images, Nissl volumes, and annotation atlases. The Atlas-Download-Tools library can help you to download single section images and entire datasets, as well as the corresponding metadata. It can further pre-process the image data to place it in the standard reference space.
