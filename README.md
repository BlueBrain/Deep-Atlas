# Deep Atlas
Deep Atlas is a suite of tools created by the Blue Brain Project to manipulate
brain atlas images. 
- [Atlas Download Tools](#atlas-download-tools) — Search, download, and prepare
  atlas data.
- [Atlas Alignment](#atlas-alignment) — Perform multimodal image registration
  and alignment.
- [Atlas Annotation](#atlas-annotation) — Image registration for region
  annotation atlases.
- [Atlas Interpolation](#atlas-interpolation) — Slice interpolation for atlases.

**Search, download, and prepare atlas data.**

Among different sources of data, Allen Brain Institute hosts a rich database of
gene expression images, Nissl volumes, and annotation atlases. The
Atlas-Download-Tools library can help you to download single section images and
entire datasets, as well as the corresponding metadata. It can further
pre-process the image data to place it in the standard reference space.

**Multimodal registration and alignment toolbox.**

Atlas Alignment is a toolbox to perform multimodal image registration. It
includes both traditional and supervised deep learning models. This project
originated from the Blue Brain Project efforts on aligning mouse brain atlases
obtained with ISH gene expression and Nissl stains.
